I will be sending a link to the diff via GitHub.

## Overview:

Looks great!  I'm looking forward to a demo of the board.  There are no glaring issues, just suggestions and nitpicks.

Notes:
- thanks for using figaro
- good use of vendor/assets
- impressive js AND rjs

(after demo/discussion)
Great job interfacing with the chess libraries.  I had a throughly enjoyable talk about this today.  It's the kind of talk I would love to have over lunch at the office.  I think it would be fun to work on this and move it forward.  Makes me want to play chess again.  I'm surprised by how much I forget, strategy-wise.

Nice. I can move chess pieces and it records the moves?  Sweet.

While the chessboard is really cool, the UI work you personally did really just met  expectations - which is a great place to be.

A pleasure to review.  I had a few nitpics and suggestions.
